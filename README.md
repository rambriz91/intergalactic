# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This assignment required me to create a quiz that adjusts dynamically using javascript. After the user clicks the start button, they are presented with questions. If answered correctly the next question is rendered; however, if the wrong question is selected, then the timer is reduced by 5 seconds. If the player successfully answers all the questions they win the game and they are able to record their score. If the timer runs out the player loses.

## Tasks 

- Created an interactive quiz that renders quiz prompts and answer buttons dynamically after the start button is clicked.
- Implemented a game timer that handles time and win conditions.
- Implemented a penalty function that subtracts from the user time and score if questions are answered incorrectly.
- IF the timer reaches 0 the user loses the game.
- If the player wins, they are able to record their score in the local storage.
- If the user clicks view scores they can see their past scores.
